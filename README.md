\# 🧾 Invoice2EDI



Hi! 👋 This project was built to solve a very common need in logistics and system integrations: converting a Brazilian electronic invoice (NFe in XML format) into a simplified EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) `.txt` file.



The goal was to create something clean, functional, and focused on working with XML data in Java — extracting key info like CNPJ, product, quantity and price, and formatting it all into a readable `.txt`.

\## 💡 What this project does:



\- Reads a `.xml` NFe invoice file  

\- Extracts main data (CNPJ, product, quantity, price)  

\- Converts it to a `.txt` in EDI-like format  

\- Everything runs through the terminal — no UI needed

XML parsing (DOM)

File I/O

Simple EDI structure formatting

I'm Isabelly, 20 years old, and currently transitioning into the back-end development world.

This project is part of my learning journey with Java and system integrations — and also a little love letter to my background in EDI!



I love solving real problems with clean and simple code.
